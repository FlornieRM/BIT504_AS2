# BIT504_AT2_Task2

**Tic-Tac-Toe Game Development**

**Sypnosis**
This project involves completing a partially developed Tic-Tac-Toe game, building upon existing code. The provided codebase includes some implemented features, accompanied by TODO comments that outline the remaining tasks to be addressed. The game utilizes a JPanel to render Noughts and Crosses on a canvas, providing a graphical user interface. My objective is to finish the game by completing the outstanding tasks, ensuring a fully functional and playable Tic-Tac-Toe experience.

**Project Structure**
The code is structured across multiple Java classes, which are:

_GameBoard_: Manages the game board display.
_GameController_: Handles game rules and player moves.
_Player_: Sets up player details.
_Main_: Starts the game.
